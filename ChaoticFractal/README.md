## Here we showcase how an intractable simple system can be integrated over itself to reveal highly symmetric orderings; containing chaos in fractals.

#### The idea was adopted from this video: https://youtu.be/C5Jkgvw-Z6E by Hiro Shimoyama

In the video, a pendulum is dangled above 3 equidistant attractors (magnetic), <br>
and when let go from a point, the pendulum wiggles about before inevitably converging onto one of the 3 attractors. <br>
Which attractor the pendulum will converge upon, given initial position $(x_i, y_i)$, is realistically intractable. <br>
This intractability is consequent to the inherent non-linearity, and subsequently the trajectories are chaotic. <br>

To recover the fractal, each initial position (x,y) on the grid is tested, and the attractor it converges upon determines its color.

#### This Python interpretation has many adjustable and explorable possibilites.

Note that these fractals are of the non-differentiable kind, at least in their limit. <br>
That is to say they are not necessarily self-simmilar as is colloquially attributed to the fractal.
Ultimately, this a result of the non-linearity of the given system.
The connection between chaos and fractals is known, but the details of such remains an open mystery.
