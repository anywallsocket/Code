## Here we showcase how an intractable simple system can be integrated over itself to reveal highly symmetric orderings; containing chaos in fractals.

#### The idea was adopted from this video: https://youtu.be/C5Jkgvw-Z6E by Hiro Shimoyama

#### This Python interpretation has many adjustable and explorable possibilites.

Note that these fractals are of the non-differentiable kind, at least in their limit, not of the self-symmetric kind.
This is ultimately a result of the non-linearity of the given system. Not much is known about these connections.
