## Programs for mapping numerical digits to 2d walks

The jupyter notebook explores the basic idea using transcendental numbers:
  map the digits of a number like pi, 31415... to directions, e.g., 3=up, 1=left, etc.
  This is done by dividing 180 or 360 degrees into the appropriate base, however you want.
  Regardless, consistent patterns emerge, unique to the transcendental number and its base.
  
The python program takes this a step further, mapping 1/p, where p is a prime.
  The prime reciprocals are repeating decimals with different periods of repetition.
  Depending on 1/p and its base, you often get star-like patterns as exemplified below.

This is (as far as I know) an unexplored domain, ripe for those interested.
