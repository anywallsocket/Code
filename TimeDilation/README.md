How to interpret:

For example, we see that the GPS reads ~ + 38 microsecond dilation per day.
This means that, relative to us, its clocks are 38 microseconds ahead (older).

Likewise we see that the ISS reads ~ -26 microsecond dilation per day.
This means that, relative to us, its clocks are 26 microseconds behind (younger).

The discrepancy is understood by realizing that, relative to us: 
The GPS is much farther out of the Earth's gravity well, so its clocks are not slowed as much as ours.
The ISS is deep in Earth's gravity well just like us, so its velocity slows its clocks even more than ours.

Therefore the z-axis can be interpreted as microseconds faster (positive) and microseconds slower (negative).
