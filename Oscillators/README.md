# Classically-Coupled-Oscillators
Numerical simulations of coupled oscillators.

Multiple methods of integration are implemented, via odeint() and solve_ivp().

The problem of noise in relation to phase transition is also explored.

Below we see one of the main results:

That is, the phase transition point (y-axis),
as a function of the first oscillator constant, and noise levels.

This has application for novel diode / Josephson junction computation and memory arrays.
